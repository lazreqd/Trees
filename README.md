## Introduction


## Original Data
The original ReforesTree dataset can be downloaded on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/6813783). This dataset includes raw drone RGB images, hand measured field data (tree species, diameter, biomass, etc.), a set of bounding boxes of trees for each site, and mappings of these bounding boxes with GPS locations.
